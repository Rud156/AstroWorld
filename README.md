# AstroWorld
A game where you try to kill enemies to retrieve batteries to power your spacecraft and return to base. But beware, enemies alert other if they are too close.
<br /> <br />
The main objective of the game was to try and create a stealth based game where the primary focus was to make sure that the player couldn't easily attack the enemies and thus a stratergy needed to be formed to win the game.
